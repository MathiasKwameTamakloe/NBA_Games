# NBA_Games

**Project Steps**

Download the necessary packages: Begin by installing the required packages and dependencies to run the project.

**Data assessment**: Perform an initial assessment of the NBA_games dataset. Understand the structure of the data, identify missing values, outliers, or any data quality issues.

**Data cleaning/preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for analysis and modeling. Handle missing values, outliers, data formatting, and any other necessary data transformations.

**Feature selection**: Select the relevant features from the dataset that will be used to train the prediction algorithm. Consider factors such as team statistics, player performance, historical data, and other relevant features.

**Model building**: Build a prediction algorithm using machine learning techniques. Explore various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks to find the best model for the task. Train the model using the prepared dataset.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Analyze the model's strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement.

**Model deploymen**t: Deploy the trained model in a suitable environment for future predictions. Create an interface or API that allows users to input relevant game data and receive predictions for the game outcomes.
